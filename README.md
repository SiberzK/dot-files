Emacs config goals:

1) Lightweight
2) Convenient (simple quality of life improvements)
3) Easy to use (no crazy changes, so other Emacs users can use it without having to re-map their fingers)
4) Prefer core packages over third-party packages (e.g fido-vertical-mode vs ivy-mode, or eglot vs lsp-mode)
5) Sanity.
